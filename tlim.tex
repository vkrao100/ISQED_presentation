\begin{frame}{\large Proposed Timeline}
\bi
\item Summer 2020: \bi
			\item As part of efficiency improvement, enhance the multi-fix framework engine implemented in 
			Polybori using ZDD as the underlying data structure.
			\item Explore word-level don't care formulation in multi-fix setup.
			\item Formulate rectification setup in terms of internal circuit variables
					so as to reuse the existing logic. 
			\item Devise algorithms to explore the internal don't cares and obtain rectification functions with low implementation/synthesis costs in terms of area/delay of the circuit. 
			\ei
	\item Fall 2020:\bi
			\item Extend the multi-fix approach to integer arithmetic circuits and address the associated challenges.
			\ei
	\item Spring 2021:\bi
	 		\item Evaluate data. Write and defend the dissertation.
